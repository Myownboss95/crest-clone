                  <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
                      <p>Here is how the copier works: You, as an investor, simply select an expert or experts that
                        you want to copy trades from. Once you are signed up, this is the only action needed on your
                        part.</p><br>
                      <p>Once you’ve taken care of the above, you are all set. There are no codes that you need to run
                        or signals for you to manually input. Our software will handle the trade copying automatically
                        on your behalf. We monitor your experts trading activity and as soon as there is a trade, we
                        calculate all the necessary parameters and execute the trade.</p><br>
                      <p>The only thing you have to make sure of is that you have enough available base currency that
                        your expert trades with, in your trading account. How much is enough? First, you must meet the
                        exchanges minimum order amount (let’s say about $10 per trade to be safe). That means that if
                        your expert executes a 5% order, you must have at least $300 in your account total value (at
                        100% expert allocation as an example). This also means that you need to have at least 10% or
                        higher in available base currency to avoid missed trades.</p><br>
                      <p>When the expert exits a position, you too will exit it. Automatically. You can also change
                        allocation at any time.</p>

                      <p>We carefully select expert applicants. We get to know them as a trader and examine their
                        trading performance over a period of time. We also tend to look for expert who already have a
                        following to further confirm their competence (social proof). You can also read about every
                        expert on their individual performance pages.</p><br>

                    Try opening it in some other browser. We recommend using the latest Google Chrome.

                    business days (depending on your payment provider.)

                    If the money has not been credited to your account right after you make a deposit, please wait for
                    1 hour. If after 1 hour there is still no money, please wait and check again.

                    Bonus is the money the company provides to a client for trading. Traders don't lose their own
                    funds when they lose a bonus. On the other hand, in case of success, they pocket the profit gained
                    from using bonus funds.

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
                    A quote session is a period when the platform receives and transmits quotes. However, one can make
                    trades within a slightly shorter trading session, which is part of a quote session.

                    As a rule, a quote session starts 5-10 minutes earlier and ends 5-10 minutes later than the
                    trading session. This is meant to protect traders from the risk of high volatility at the
                    beginning and the end of the quote session.

                    For example, a quote session for Apple shares starts at 13:30 GMT (US Summer Time) and ends at
                    20:00. A trading session for Apple shares starts with a five-minute delay, i.e. at 13:35. And it
                    ends at 19:55, which is 5 minutes before the quote session ends.

                <div class="collapsible-body"><span>
                    Trading activity depends on the working hours of major exchanges and increases at the time of
                    important news releases. The most active trading sessions are European and North American ones.
                    The European session begins at around 6:00 UTC and closes at 15:00 UTC. The North American trading
                    session spans from 13:00 UTC until 22:00 UTC.

                    Please note that some currency pairs and assets are available for trading for a limited period of
                    time. The trading hours for each asset are specified in the “Trading Conditions” tab of the asset
                     menu.
